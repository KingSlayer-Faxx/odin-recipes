    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made by layering flat sheets of pasta with a rich filling and then baking it until bubbly and golden. While variations exist, a traditional recipe typically involves three main components: a meat-based red sauce, a creamy cheese filling, and lasagna noodles.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p><b>The Sauce:</b> A flavorful meat sauce, often a bolognese, is made with ground beef and/or Italian sausage, cooked with aromatic vegetables like onion, garlic, carrots, and celery, and simmered in a tomato base with herbs and spices.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>The Filling:</b> The creamy layer can be made with a mixture of cheeses. A popular combination includes ricotta, mozzarella, and parmesan, sometimes with an egg to help the mixture set. Some recipes, particularly those from Northern Italy, use a béchamel sauce (a white sauce made with butter, flour, and milk) instead of or in addition to the ricotta mixture.</p></li>
        <li><p><b>Assembly and Baking:</b> The dish is assembled by spreading a thin layer of sauce on the bottom of a baking dish, followed by a layer of cooked (or no-boil) lasagna noodles. The creamy cheese filling and more meat sauce are then added, and the process is repeated until the dish is filled. The top is typically finished with a generous layer of mozzarella and parmesan cheese. The lasagna is then baked until the sauce is bubbling and the cheese is melted and browned. It's often recommended to let it rest for a short time after baking to allow the layers to set, making it easier to slice and serve.</p></li>

        <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
        <li>½ cup water</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
        <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
        <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
        <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 ½ hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To assemble, spread 1 ½ cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlapping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 ½ cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
