    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Gulab jamun is a beloved Indian dessert consisting of soft, spongy spheres made from milk solids (khoya) or milk powder. These deep-fried dough balls are soaked in a fragrant sugar syrup infused with cardamom and rose water, giving them their characteristic floral aroma and sweet flavor. They are often served warm and can be garnished with chopped nuts like pistachios or almonds.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <h4>For the Jamuns</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup milk powder</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour (maida)</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp baking soda</li>
        <li>2 tbsp ghee (clarified butter), melted</li>
        <li>1/4 cup milk, or as needed to form a soft dough</li>
        <li>Oil or ghee for deep frying</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>For the Sugar Syrup</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>4-5 green cardamom pods, lightly crushed</li>
        <li>1 tbsp rose water</li>
        <li>A few strands of saffron (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Sugar Syrup:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a saucepan, combine the sugar, water, and crushed cardamom pods.</li>
            <li>Heat the mixture over medium-high heat, stirring until the sugar dissolves completely.</li>
            <li>Once it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for about 5-7 minutes. You don't need a thick, syrupy consistencyâ€”just a slightly sticky one.</li>
            <li>Turn off the heat and stir in the rose water and saffron strands (if using). Cover the saucepan to keep the syrup warm.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Prepare the Dough:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the milk powder, all-purpose flour, and baking soda.</li>
            <li>Add the melted ghee and mix with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs.</li>
            <li>Gradually add milk, a little at a time, and gently knead to form a soft, smooth, and crack-free dough. Be careful not to over-knead, as this can result in hard jamuns.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 5-10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Shape and Fry the Jamuns:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Divide the dough into 12-15 equal parts.</li>
            <li>Grease your palms with a little ghee and roll each part into a smooth, crack-free sphere.</li>
            <li>Heat oil or ghee for deep frying in a deep pan or kadai over low-medium heat. The oil should not be too hot; otherwise, the jamuns will cook on the outside and remain raw on the inside. A good indicator is when a small piece of dough dropped in the oil sizzles gently and rises slowly.</li>
            <li>Carefully place 4-5 jamuns into the hot oil. Fry them on low heat, gently and continuously swirling the oil with a slotted spoon to ensure even browning. Do not poke the jamuns directly.</li>
            <li>Fry until they turn a uniform golden-brown to deep brown color, which can take about 8-10 minutes per batch.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>Soak the Jamuns:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Using a slotted spoon, carefully remove the fried jamuns from the oil and immediately drop them into the warm sugar syrup.</li>
            <li>Let them soak for at least 2-3 hours, or preferably overnight, for the best results. The jamuns will absorb the syrup and become soft and spongy.</li>
        </ol>
        <li>serve:</li>
        <ol>
            <li>Serve the gulab jamuns warm, garnished with slivered pistachios or almonds. They can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week.</li>
        </ol>
    </ol>
